# Dev Journey

This repository documents my journey into front-end development.

After several years in other areas, I’ve decided to transition into tech and focus on learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from the ground up. 
Here, I’ll be sharing my progress through small projects, exercises, and notes as I build a solid foundation.

This space is about consistency, growth, and learning step by step — not perfection.

Feel free to follow along!
